# Pushy-Island

Disclaimer: Based on the game _Pushy Island_ from <a href="http://www.lws9.de/">Lernwerkstatt</a>. No original code was used.

## Features

### New entities not available in the original game

I implemented all entities from the original game. Additionally to that I added some new entities. They are mostly logic gates. The functionallity is explained down below in the tutorial.

### Editor

With the editor you can create your own level. It supports these functionalities:

- undo / redo
- fill
- erase
- auto smoothing corners

## How to play the game

The main goal of the game is to reach the hut on the island. For that you use the arrow keys. But to enter the hut you have to solve all tasks on the island.

### Game mechanics

There are three main height level.
- Water (0)
- Sand (1)
- Grass (2)

You can't walk on water, except you have a *boat*. You can jump from grass to sand, but not from sand to grass. For that you need a spring. Its the same with movable entities. You can push down a entity from grass to sand, but not the other way around.

#### Hut

#### Tree

#### Stone

#### Box

The box is a moveable entity. It can be pushed into water. If a box is pushed into the water you can walk on it. You can also push entities on the box in the water. With them you can build bridges to other islands.
A box on land destroys flying stones shot from a slingshot.
